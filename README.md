Advent of Code 2017
===================

Another personal voyage of Haskell discovery.

This time I will try very hard not to cheat.

Each day, my program will strictly print two lines to stdout -- the two answers -- and then get uploaded to Github in its first working form.

I'll probably come back to tidy them up later, but meanwhile this should be hilarious and awful in equal measure.
