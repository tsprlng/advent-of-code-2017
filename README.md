Advent of Code 2017
===================

Another personal voyage of better-late-than-never Haskell discovery.

This time I will try very hard not to cheat.

Each day, my program will strictly print two lines to stdout -- the two answers -- and then get uploaded to Github in its first working form.

I'll probably come back to tidy them up later, but meanwhile this should be hilarious and awful in equal measure.


Observations
------------

*Day 9:* I seem to be consciously limiting myself to the base libraries... apart from Parsec, which again seems too good to ignore, particularly as regexes are old boring news to me nowadays.

*Day 14:* As my overall enthusiasm slumps, the code quality is noticeably decreasing (or so it seems). Nonetheless I'm still learning something each day from this exercise. Will I keep up?
